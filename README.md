***Note:***
This project is an effort to keep the original [django-iprestrict](https://github.com/muccg/django-iprestrict) project alive and updated.
The original project isn't maintained anymore by my previous employer, so I took on forking and maintaining the project for existing users.

See the comments on the following Pull Request and Issue for more background info:
* https://github.com/muccg/django-iprestrict/pull/57
* https://github.com/muccg/django-iprestrict/issues/60

Switching to `django-iprestrict-redux` is as easy as declaring `django-iprestrict-redux` instead of `django-iprestrict` as a dependency in whatever you use for managing dependencies. (ex. setup.py, requirements files, poetry etc.)
