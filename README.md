[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sztamas/django-iprestrict-redux.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sztamas/django-iprestrict-redux) [![PyPI](https://badge.fury.io/py/django-iprestrict-redux.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-iprestrict-redux) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/django-iprestrict/badge/?version=latest)](http://django-iprestrict.readthedocs.org/en/latest/?badge=latest)

_Note:
This project is an effort to keep the original [django-iprestrict](https://github.com/muccg/django-iprestrict) project alive and updated.
The original project isn't maintained anymore by my previous employer, so I took on forking and maintaining the project for existing users.

See the comments on the following Pull Request and Issue for more background info:
* https://github.com/muccg/django-iprestrict/pull/57
